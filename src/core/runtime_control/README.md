# src/core/runtime_control

Runtime measurement/admission/observation/record/watchdog modules. Start at
[`bootstrap.py`](bootstrap.py), [`admission.py`](admission.py), and the
current admission boundary. The [runtime estimation guide](../../../docs/design/runtime_estimation_and_calibration.md)
is historical design context, not a second execution authority.
Focused admission tests are in [`test_admission.py`](../../../tests/unit/core/test_admission.py);
forecasts and blocking measurements are distinct authorities.

See [the parent guide](../README.md) for child ownership and the focused validation route.
