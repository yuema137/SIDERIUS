# Time-Budget Estimator Skill

**Status**: design (awaiting approval)
**Author**: design discussion 2026-04-16
**Motivation**: two trial-mode runs (`exploit_cnn_v1`, `explore_novel_v1`) stalled in Round 1 for 1h 50min and 2h 27min respectively, both blowing past the 1-hour trial budget stated in the expert advice. Neither was blocked, because the planner has no pre-flight wall-time estimate — only a VRAM check.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 What happened

Both runs were killed mid-training on 2026-04-16 with no experiment completed. Step-count arithmetic (at `batch_size=1, train_portion=1.0, epochs=1`, sample_set of 400 PSD segments):

| Run | `seg_size` | ml_segs/PSD | total steps | observed ms/step | projected train time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exploit_cnn_v1` | 16000 | 625 | 250,000 | ~26 ms | ~1.8 h (unfinished) |
| `explore_novel_v1` | 1250 | 8000 | 3,200,000 | ~2.7 ms | ~2.4 h (unfinished) |

The explore run chose `seg_size=1250` to stay under the 4 GB VRAM ceiling, which inflated step count 12.8×. `evaluate_resource_skill` returned `Feasible: YES` in both cases because it only checks VRAM.

### 1.2 Root cause

`agent/skills/evaluate_resource_skill/wrapper.py` returns only a VRAM verdict. Time cost is absent from the planning gate. The LLM's expert-advice prose says "each trial must complete within 1 hour" but nothing enforces it — the planner is free to pick configs whose step count × ms-per-step exceeds the budget by an order of magnitude.

### 1.3 Secondary issue (out of scope here — tracked separately)

`run_exploration_adaptive.py:187-191` forces `is_trial/trial_portion/train_portion/eval_portion` via `plan_overrides`, but the LLM is never told this in the planning prompt. It keeps proposing values for those fields that get silently replaced. Fix is a prompt-only change and is addressed in a separate follow-up (not this doc).

---

## 2. Solution

Add a new atomic skill `evaluate_time_skill` that:

1. Computes **exact step counts** for training (and, in phase 2, inference) from `sample_set`, `PSD_SEGMENT_LENGTH`, `seg_size`, `train_portion`, `batch_size`, `epochs`.
2. Measures **ms-per-step** by running a 3-batch GPU micro-warmup with the actual model, loss, and optimizer on synthetic tensors of the correct shape.
3. Projects **total wall-time** = steps × ms-per-step, compares against a configurable budget, returns `feasible` / `verdict` / `suggestion` in the same shape as `evaluate_resource_skill`.
4. Is invoked as `[Step 0.5/3]` in the tune agent — after VRAM check passes, before training. On time-budget failure, skip the attempt and record `skipped_time_risk` (parallel to `skipped_oom_risk`).

### 2.1 Design choices

| Decision | Chosen | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Skill or extend `evaluate_resource_skill`? | **New skill** (`evaluate_time_skill`) | Clean separation: one checks VRAM, one checks wall-time. Easier to toggle, test, extend. Matches user's "add it as a skill" preference. |
| Static formula vs live warmup? | **Live warmup** (3 fwd+bwd batches, discard first as warmup, average last two) | Step count varies 12× between configs; models introduce spectral/attention ops a static formula can't capture. Overhead ~2–5 s per plan — cheap relative to 2-hour blowups. Also makes the estimate **self-calibrating per server** (see §2.6). |
| Budget source? | **CLI flag** `--time_budget_minutes` on `run_exploration_adaptive.py`, default 60 | Decouples enforcement from advice prose. Advice stays human-readable; the number is a system constant. |
| Include inference estimate? | **Phase 2** — train-only in phase 1 | Train was the sole cause of the 1h 50min / 2h 27min blowups. Inference adds code surface for a smaller effect. Phase 2 extends the same skill. |
| Placement in tune loop? | `[Step 0.5/3]` between VRAM check and training | Matches existing gate pattern. Both gates use the same `skipped_*` record format and don't burn a tuning round. |
| Cross-server accuracy? | **Live warmup + safety multiplier + post-hoc calibration file** | No hand-maintained per-server constants; see §2.6 for details. |

### 2.2 Step-count formulae

```
train_steps_per_epoch = ceil(
    n_train_psd_segs × (PSD_SEGMENT_LENGTH // seg_size) × train_portion / train_batch_size
)
total_train_steps     = train_steps_per_epoch × epochs

inference_steps       = ceil(                                       # phase 2
    n_eval_psd_segs × (PSD_SEGMENT_LENGTH // seg_size) / inference_batch_size
)
```

Where `n_train_psd_segs = sum(len(v) for v in train_sample_set.values())`, `PSD_SEGMENT_LENGTH = 10_000_000` (from `execute_tools.dataset_config`). `inference_batch_size` uses the per-model defaults from `sandbox_executor.py` (phase 2).

### 2.3 Skill output schema

```python
{
    "status":           "success" | "error",
    "feasible":         bool,
    "verdict":          str,    # "✅ FITS" / "❌ OVER BUDGET" with numbers
    "suggestion":       str,    # e.g. "Reduce num_blocks" or "Increase seg_size to X"
    "estimated_minutes": float,
    "limit_minutes":     float,
    "breakdown": {
        "total_train_steps":   int,
        "ms_per_step":         float,
        "warmup_batches":      int,
        "train_minutes":       float,
    },
    "message":           str,   # on error only
}
```

### 2.4 Suggestion logic

On over-budget, pick the dominant lever:

1. If `seg_size < 10_000` and `train_batch_size == 1` → suggest raising `batch_size` first (amortizes fixed per-step cost without changing model capacity).
2. Else if `ms_per_step > 50 ms` → suggest reducing model depth/width (`num_blocks`, `hidden_channels`, `embedding_dim`).
3. Else (many cheap steps) → suggest raising `seg_size` to the next valid divisor of 10,000,000.

The tuner surfaces this to the reflector as `memory_update` on the `skipped_time_risk` record, the same way the VRAM gate does today.

### 2.5 Safety multiplier

Projected wall-time is multiplied by `SAFETY_MULTIPLIER = 1.1` before comparison with the budget. Tight (10%) because the real-dataset warmup in §2.6.3 already measures the DataLoader / HDF5 path — the multiplier only has to absorb first-step autotune and minor variance. Declared at the top of `wrapper.py` so it's trivial to tune.

### 2.6 Cross-server accuracy & learning from experience

#### 2.6.1 Why this matters

We run on **at least two substantially different GPUs**, with different disks and contention profiles:

| Server | GPU | Peak FP32 | Filesystem | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lilab | RTX 5090 (32 GB) | ~50 TFLOPS | local SSD | single-user |
| SDSC Expanse `gpu-shared` | V100 (16 GB) or A100 (40/80 GB) | 15.7 / 19.5 TFLOPS | Lustre (shared) | shared node; thermal + I/O contention |

A given config can be 2–3× slower on V100 than on RTX 5090. Hand-maintained per-server constants would rot on every upgrade or partition reassignment. Design imperative: **every signal that affects wall-time enters the estimate measurably, and every past run teaches the estimator for next time.**

#### 2.6.2 Signals in → estimate out

Every factor that changes wall-time has an explicit path into the estimate. Nothing is assumed constant across servers.

| Signal | Where it enters | How it enters |
|---|---|---|
| **GPU hardware** (FLOPs, VRAM bandwidth) | live warmup | real CUDA kernel runs on the actual device |
| **Kernel launch / PCIe latency** | live warmup | `.to(device)` on each warmup batch |
| **Model class + ops** (FFT, attention, conv) | live warmup | warmup instantiates the actual `MODEL_REGISTRY[model_type]` |
| **Model config** (seg_size, channels, depth) | live warmup + step count | warmup uses real model; step count formula uses real seg_size |
| **Batch size, loss type** | live warmup | real optimizer.step() with real criterion |
| **Sample set size** (number of PSD segments) | step count | `sum(len(v) for v in sample_set.values())` |
| **Epochs, train_portion** | step count | scales total step count |
| **Disk / filesystem** (lilab SSD vs SDSC Lustre) | live warmup | warmup reads 1 real PSD from the real `data_dir` via `TIDMADEpochDataset` |
| **DataLoader overhead** (num_workers, collate) | live warmup | warmup iterates the real `DataLoader` object, same constructor args as training |
| **HDF5 dataset build per epoch** | learned correction `k` | amortised over a full epoch, so not captured per-step by warmup; absorbed into `k` from past runs |
| **Thermal / shared-node contention** | learned correction `k` | past runs on the same GPU reveal systematic slowdown |
| **cuDNN autotune first-step spikes** | safety multiplier | absorbed by the 1.1× multiplier (tight because warmup uses real data) |
| **Past accuracy / mistakes on this hardware** | learned correction `k` (asymmetric EMA) | every completed run updates `k`; violations correct faster than accurate estimates (§2.6.5) |

Put differently: server, loader, model, and past accuracy all feed in — the first three via a real measurement taken seconds before the gate decision, the last via a persistent learned correction per (GPU, model_type).

#### 2.6.3 Real-dataset warmup (not synthetic tensors)

Original draft proposed synthetic tensors. Switching to a **real-dataset warmup** so disk + DataLoader + HDF5 path are directly measured rather than formula-estimated.

```python
# Mini sample_set: 1 PSD segment from 1 file (~10 MB read, ~100 ML batches at seg=100_000 or fewer at larger seg)
mini_sample_set = {next(iter(sample_set)): sample_set[next(iter(sample_set))][:1]}

dataset = TIDMADEpochDataset(data_dir, mini_sample_set, seg_size, train_portion=1.0, rng=Random(0))
loader  = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=train_cfg.batch_size, shuffle=False, drop_last=True)

# 3 fwd+bwd steps: discard step 0 (allocator/autotune), time steps 1 and 2
it = iter(loader)
for step in range(3):
    x, y = next(it)
    torch.cuda.synchronize()
    t0 = time.perf_counter()
    # standard train step ...
    torch.cuda.synchronize()
    if step > 0: timings.append(time.perf_counter() - t0)

ms_per_step_warmup = 1000 * mean(timings)
```

Cost: one HDF5 file open, ~20 MB read, 3 GPU steps. Total ~1–3 s on either server. This replaces the formula-based DataLoader guess with a direct measurement, tightening the safety multiplier from 1.25× to 1.1×.

Fallback path for CPU / no-data-dir: static formula `ms_per_step ≈ params × seg_size × 1e-9 s` with a printed warning. Used only in unit tests.

#### 2.6.4 GPU / server identification

Identify by the **GPU, not the hostname**. Use `torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)`, which yields stable portable keys (`"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090"`, `"Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB"`) that survive SDSC node reassignment.

The calibration file is keyed on this GPU name, slugified:

```
{HOME}/.siderius/time_calibration_{gpu_slug}.json   # e.g. time_calibration_nvidia_geforce_rtx_5090.json
```

Lives outside the workspace so it persists across runs. Ignored by git — each machine builds its own.

#### 2.6.5 Learning from experience (asymmetric EMA)

Every experiment that completes training writes a record linking prediction to reality:

```json
{
  "gpu_name":             "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090",
  "model_type":           "dual_context_skip_fuser",
  "seg_size":             16000,
  "batch_size":            1,
  "total_steps":          250000,
  "warmup_ms_per_step":    21.2,    // what we measured at pre-flight
  "actual_ms_per_step":    26.05,   // train_time_s * 1000 / total_steps
  "ratio":                 1.229,   // actual / warmup
  "estimated_minutes":     110.4,   // what the gate predicted
  "actual_minutes":        108.5,   // ground truth
  "estimate_violated":     false,   // actual / estimated > 1.0
  "timestamp":             "2026-04-16T13:45:00Z"
}
```

The correction factor `k(gpu, model_type)` is maintained by an **asymmetric EMA**:

```
r = actual_ms_per_step / warmup_ms_per_step

if actual_minutes > estimated_minutes:   # we under-predicted → punish hard
    k_new = α_up   * r + (1 - α_up)   * k_old      # α_up   = 0.5
else:                                     # we over-predicted → drift gently
    k_new = α_down * r + (1 - α_down) * k_old      # α_down = 0.1

k_new = clip(k_new, 0.5, 5.0)                      # prevent pathological runs from poisoning
```

Rationale: a missed budget (estimate too low) is the expensive failure mode — it wastes hours. An over-cautious estimate only costs the LLM a slightly smaller config. So learning asymmetrically toward safety is the right bias. `α_up > α_down` makes every mistake correct 5× faster than every success. The clip prevents a single broken run (e.g. segfault mid-training) from corrupting the table.

Lookup falls back in order: `(gpu, model_type)` → `(gpu, *)` → `1.0`.

Final estimate:

```
ms_per_step_estimate = warmup_ms_per_step × k(gpu, model_type) × 1.1       # safety multiplier
total_minutes        = ms_per_step_estimate × total_steps / 60000
```

#### 2.6.6 Drift detection

If three consecutive runs on the same GPU violate their estimates (`actual_minutes > estimated_minutes`) — even after the EMA has had a chance to correct — emit a warning. This catches qualitative changes the EMA can't track smoothly: driver upgrade, partition switch (gpu-shared → gpu-debug), a neighboring job hogging the node. User intervention: clear the calibration file or investigate the environment.

#### 2.6.7 Accuracy layers summary

| Layer | Captures | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Real-dataset live warmup | GPU, disk, DataLoader, HDF5 path, model class — all at once | 1 (Phase C) |
| × 1.1 safety multiplier | First-step autotune, minor variance | 1 (Phase D) |
| × learned `k(gpu, model_type)` via asymmetric EMA | Per-epoch HDF5 overhead, thermal drift, systematic mistakes | 1 (Phase F) |
| Drift-detection warning | Hardware/partition changes | 1 (Phase F) |

All four layers are in phase 1. The calibration file is not deferred to "phase 2" — user emphasised *learning from mistake* should be a first-class feature, not a follow-up.

---

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In scope (phase 1)

- New skill `agent/skills/evaluate_time_skill/` with `wrapper.py`, `skill_config.json`.
- **Real-dataset micro-warmup** (1 PSD × 1 file × 3 fwd+bwd batches) for ms-per-step measurement. Falls back to static formula on CPU with a warning.
- **Per-GPU learned calibration file** `~/.siderius/time_calibration_{gpu_slug}.json` with asymmetric-EMA correction factor `k(gpu, model_type)` and drift detection.
- Post-training hook that records `(warmup, actual, estimated, violated)` to the calibration file and updates `k`.
- `[Step 0.5/3]` integration in `nodes/ml_hyperparameter_tune_agent.py` — fail → `skipped_time_risk` record, no round consumed.
- CLI flag `--time_budget_minutes` on `run_exploration_adaptive.py`, plumbed through `run_workflow()` and into the tune agent.
- Unit tests: skill in isolation with mocked torch, asymmetric-EMA math, calibration-file I/O. Integration test with a tiny real model on GPU.

### 3.2 Out of scope (deferred)

- Inference-time estimate (phase 2 — additive, same skill).
- Override-disclosure prompt change (separate doc/PR).
- Budget enforcement in formal (non-trial) mode — formal runs are expected to be long; phase 1 gates trial mode only.
- Cross-user calibration sharing (each SDSC user builds their own file; no central store).

---

## 5. Backward Compatibility

- The skill is purely additive. Existing flows that don't pass `time_budget_minutes` see no behavior change — the tune agent treats a missing budget as "skip the time gate" (feasible=True, warning printed once).
- `HyperparamTuningInput.time_budget_minutes` is optional with default `None`. Existing config JSON round-trips unchanged.
- No changes to record schemas except adding `"skipped_time_risk"` as an allowed `status` value in `ExperimentRecord` (mirrors existing `"skipped_oom_risk"`).

---

## 6. Testing Approach

### 6.1 Unit (phase 1)

- `tests/unit/agent/skills/test_evaluate_time_skill.py`:
  - Step-count math is correct for `seg_size ∈ {1000, 16000, 50000}`, `batch_size ∈ {1, 4}`, `train_portion ∈ {0.1, 1.0}`.
  - Returns `feasible=True` when estimate < budget, `feasible=False` when estimate > budget.
  - Suggestion logic picks the expected lever for each of the three branches.
  - `status="error"` on malformed model config or missing required keys.
  - Warmup is mocked so the test runs without GPU.

### 6.2 Integration (phase 1)

- `tests/integration/agent/test_evaluate_time_skill.py` (`@real_run`):
  - Tiny `tinynet` model on real GPU, confirm skill returns a plausible `ms_per_step` (sanity: 0.5 ms < ms/step < 500 ms).
  - End-to-end: call tune agent in pseudo mode with a config known to exceed budget, confirm `skipped_time_risk` record is emitted and no training runs.

### 6.3 Smoke

- Re-run a shortened `exploit_cnn_v1` config with `--time_budget_minutes 30` and confirm the skill blocks it with a reasonable suggestion, instead of starting the 2-hour training.

## 7. Phased Implementation Checklist

Each phase ends with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/agent/skills/ -q` (or the phase-specific target) and a committable state.

### Phase A — Skill scaffold [x]

- [x] Create `agent/skills/evaluate_time_skill/{__init__.py, skill_config.json, wrapper.py}`.
- [x] `wrapper.py` returns a stub dict matching the full output contract — no real computation yet.
- [x] `skill_config.json` describes inputs (`model_type, model_config, train_config, loss_config, sample_set, train_portion, time_budget_minutes, data_dir`).
- [x] Confirm `_run_skill("evaluate_time_skill", ...)` discoverable from the tune agent.
- **Verified** (2026-04-16): `importlib.import_module("agent.skills.evaluate_time_skill.wrapper")` succeeds; `run_skill()` returns `{status, feasible, verdict, suggestion, estimated_minutes, limit_minutes, breakdown}` with the expected keys.

### Phase B — Step-count math + static fallback [ ]

- [ ] Implement the step-count formulae from §2.2 in `wrapper.py`.
- [ ] Add a static `ms_per_step ≈ params × seg_size × 1e-9 s` fallback used when `device != "cuda"` or when a `--skip_warmup` flag is set (for unit tests on CPU).
- [ ] Unit tests for step-count math (covers the 6 cases listed in §6.1).
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/agent/skills/test_evaluate_time_skill.py -q` passes (6+ tests).

### Phase C — Real-dataset live warmup [ ]

- [ ] In `wrapper.py`, add `_measure_ms_per_step(model, train_cfg, loss_cfg, data_dir, sample_set)`: build a 1-PSD `TIDMADEpochDataset` → real `DataLoader` → run 3 fwd+bwd steps with `torch.cuda.synchronize()`, discard step 0, average steps 1–2.
- [ ] Guard with `torch.cuda.is_available()` and `os.path.isdir(data_dir)`; fall back to static formula with a warning when either is missing.
- [ ] Reuse `evaluate_resource_skill._count_params`'s model instantiation path to avoid drift. The warmup model is disposed (`del model; torch.cuda.empty_cache()`) before returning.
- **Verify**: inline smoke — call the skill on `tinynet` with real GPU, confirm ms/step is a finite positive float and varies with `seg_size` in the expected direction (larger seg_size → higher ms/step).

### Phase D — Suggestion logic + verdict formatting [ ]

- [ ] Implement the 3-branch suggestion logic from §2.4.
- [ ] Format `verdict` to match `evaluate_resource_skill` style (✅/❌ prefix, minutes instead of GB).
- [ ] `SAFETY_MULTIPLIER = 1.1` constant at module top.
- [ ] Unit tests for each suggestion branch.
- **Verify**: unit suite passes, verdict strings are human-readable.

### Phase E — Tuner integration [ ]

- [ ] Add `[Step 0.5/3]` call in `nodes/ml_hyperparameter_tune_agent.py` after the existing VRAM check. Follow the exact structure of the VRAM gate (error check, feasible check, record emission).
- [ ] Define `skipped_time_risk` status and wire it into `ExperimentRecord` if not already accepted.
- [ ] `HyperparamTuningInput` gains `time_budget_minutes: Optional[float] = None`; when `None`, print a one-time warning and skip the gate.
- [ ] Forward `time_budget_minutes` from the input down to the skill's `run_skill` call.
- **Verify**: unit tests for the tune agent's new branch (happy path, over-budget path, missing-budget path). Pseudo-mode integration test for the over-budget path. Run `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/agent/ -q`.

### Phase F — Learned calibration (asymmetric EMA) [ ]

This is where "learning from mistakes" lands. Splits into three sub-steps.

- [ ] **F1. Calibration module.** Create `agent/skills/evaluate_time_skill/calibration.py` with:
  - `load_table(gpu_name) -> dict`
  - `lookup_k(table, model_type) -> float` with fallback chain `(gpu, model_type) → (gpu, *) → 1.0`
  - `update_k(table, entry) -> dict` implementing the asymmetric EMA from §2.6.5 (`α_up=0.5`, `α_down=0.1`, clip `[0.5, 5.0]`)
  - `save_table(gpu_name, table)` with atomic write (tmp file + rename)
  - `detect_drift(table, last_n=3) -> Optional[str]` returns a warning message if last N entries all violated
- [ ] **F2. Pre-flight use.** In `wrapper.py`, after measuring `warmup_ms_per_step`, look up `k` and compute `ms_per_step_estimate = warmup × k × SAFETY_MULTIPLIER`. Include both `warmup_ms_per_step` and `k_used` in the returned breakdown.
- [ ] **F3. Post-flight update.** In `nodes/ml_hyperparameter_tune_agent.py`, after `train_time` is recorded (around `line 469`), append a new entry to the calibration file and call `update_k`. Emit the drift warning if any. Pass the pre-flight `estimated_minutes` through from the gate's return so `estimate_violated` is computable.
- [ ] Unit tests in `test_time_calibration.py`: EMA update under over- and under-prediction, clipping, lookup fallback, drift detection on a synthetic table.
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/agent/skills/ -q`. Inline smoke — run the skill twice with the same config, confirm entry appears in the calibration file and `k` shifted as expected on the second call.

### Phase G — CLI + workflow plumbing [ ]

- [ ] Add `--time_budget_minutes` to `run_exploration_adaptive.py` (default 60).
- [ ] Thread it through `run_workflow()` → `HyperparamTuningInput.time_budget_minutes`.
- [ ] Update `run_exploration_adaptive.py`'s startup print block to show the budget.
- [ ] Add `time_calibration_*.json` to `.gitignore` if the path is ever checked into the repo tree.
- **Verify**: `.venv/bin/python run_exploration_adaptive.py --help` shows the new flag. Dry-run invocation confirms it reaches the tuner input object.

### Phase H — Smoke test + doc update [ ]

- [ ] Re-run a shortened config known to be over-budget with `--time_budget_minutes 10`. Confirm skill blocks it and the `skipped_time_risk` record lands.
- [ ] Re-run a config expected to finish in ~5 min with `--time_budget_minutes 30`. Confirm: gate passes, training completes, calibration file gains an entry, `k` is updated.
- [ ] Update this doc's Status line to `implemented`; add a Progress log at the top with dates and test counts per phase.
- [ ] Decide with user: one big squash commit, or per-phase commits.

---

## 8. Rollback Plan

The skill is additive and gated on `time_budget_minutes is not None`. To disable at any point:

- **Fastest**: set `--time_budget_minutes 0` or omit it → gate is bypassed (or, treat 0/None identically).
- **Per-run**: remove the CLI flag from the invocation.
- **Codebase rollback**: revert the commit(s) for phases E–F; phases A–D are self-contained and safe to leave in place as a dormant skill.

No data-layer changes, no schema changes that block older records from loading (the new `skipped_time_risk` value is additive to the enum).

---

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Warmup batch count**: 3 (1 warmup + 2 timed) vs 5? I'll start with 3 in Phase C and revisit if variance on SDSC shared nodes is high.
2. **Budget default**: 60 min matches the current expert-advice prose. Formal-mode gate is deferred; if we enable it later, default is probably 4 h.
3. **EMA α constants**: `α_up=0.5, α_down=0.1` are educated guesses. Once a few real entries accumulate, sanity-check these by replay — do we converge too slow/fast? Tune then.
4. **Calibration file location**: `~/.siderius/` by default; override with `SIDERIUS_CALIBRATION_DIR` env var so SDSC users can point to `$HOME` or `$SCRATCH` depending on quota.
5. **`skipped_time_risk` enum location**: wherever `skipped_oom_risk` lives in the record schema — confirm path in Phase E.
